If the sequence doesn't follow either pattern return -1. An arithmetic sequence is one where the difference between each of the numbers is consistent, where as in a geometric sequence, each term after the first is multiplied by some constant or common ratio. Arithmetic example: [2, 4, 6, 8] and Geometric example: [2, 6, 18, 54]. Negative numbers may be entered as parameters, 0 will not be entered, and no array will contain all the same elements.","Sample Test Cases","","Input:5,10,15","","Output:\"Arithmetic\"","","Input:2,4,16,24","","Output:-1"],"id":1}]]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":0,"scrollleft":0,"selection":{"start":{"row":8,"column":6},"end":{"row":8,"column":15},"isBackwards":true},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":true,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":0},"timestamp":1540488672440,"hash":"4400c33c85225b01b80e2849f5d551ed424ab8f0"}
